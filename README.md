# todo-list
In this project, I will be creating a todo-list app. A classic web development project for beginners. I will be using HTML, vanilla CSS & Javascript along with Webpack as my module bundler.

I will practice and apply the concepts I've learned thus far in order to create this app.
I'll do my best to create organized ES6 modules during this process.

I'm looking forward to putting these techniques into practice and demonstrating my skills so far.
